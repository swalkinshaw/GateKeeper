GateKeeper Extension for Google Chrome
==================================

This extension removes "Like Gating" from a Facebook Tab.

Like Gating is when a Facebook tab makes you Like the page before being able 
to see the real content.

Upon detecting a tab employing this technique, GateKeeper automatically 
removes the Like Gate and shows the real content. The GateKeeper icon 
(a Facebook "Like" thumb) will appear in the URL bar to notify you when 
this has been done.

Clicking the icon allows you to toggle between the two Like states.

You can install the extension at the [offical
Google Extension site][extension_site].
